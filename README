			Tag File System
			
Copyright: never think about that.

Install:
	This filesystem requires the followings:
		Python 2.6
		FUSE-2 library
		Python-fuse library
		Better in a Linux box
	Python version < 2.6 is not supported.
	Python 3000 is not tested yet. If you insist, try convert the 2.6 code 
	to 3.0.
	
To Mount:
	Download the sources from GoogleCode trunk.
	In the up-most dir which contains cmd and tagfs sub-dirs, 
	run: ./tagfs/TagFS.py -o root=<the back store directory> <mount point>
	The tagfs will use <the back store directory> to store the meta data and 
	files. You can do things within <mount point> to have fun.
	If you want to monitor the status, use -d option when running TagFs.py
	to enable debug output.
	The log is in /tmp/tagfs.log
